# Get started
All components that are more `generic` and can be reused are documented on this website. The components are seperated the following way:

* __Core__ - Core components of he website, most reusable.
* __Individual folder__ - These components take up more than one file or there are multiple of these but they are not necessarily `generic` enough to be in core.
* __Standalone__ These are individual components that arent used as often but should still be their individual components for `readability` sake.
